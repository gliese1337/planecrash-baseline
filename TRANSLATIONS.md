Your strength in the Way is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality. If you're equally good at explaining any outcome you can see, that's the same as not knowing anything.

"​Taldane lacks every single component word of the compound term meaning 'an equilibrium where signals preserve their overt semantics given the incentives for both signal-senders and signal-receivers'."

"​Most kids will give the brief Baseline comeback that colloquially translates to 'I probably would have believed it, if I wasn't pretty sure you were trolling me, though I haven't seen anything that I suspect is the real argument against it'."

"​Merrin has been mulling on this, and comes up with a list of about twenty phrases for conveying: basic physical needs, several different types of warnings-of-danger, and some variations on 'I have a plan to handle this', 'I have a plan that needs input from you to complete', 'I have a plan that needs you to take an action', and 'I don't have a plan and am hoping you can do something'. The latter category is apparently something that can be crammed down into a surprisingly efficient number of syllables"

"​your language doesn't have the word, an acerbic disclaimer of how far you fell short of your own standards in the course of impressing somebody else"

"​Taldane doesn't have the Baseline word. The thing that pronouncement has in common with saying 'Those above all mortals now battle.'"

Programmer (*) A dath ilani concept essentially untranslatable to Taldane in its connotations and origins; the two-syllable word 'programmer' has an expanded six-syllable form that reads creator-of-raw-causality, where 'creator' in turn implies 'one who accepts responsibility for all consequences of creation whether intended or not' (the same word that appears in expanded 'parent' as 'creator-of-sapient-life') and 'raw-causality' means 'raw math, close to the bare bones of reality'. The nearest Taldane translation is in fact 'creator-god' if creator-gods worked to a much smaller scale.

I don't know how people express gratitude here for having meta-successfully completed the hard work of trying at something you're not sure you can do, and failing, and giving up when the time comes - as one must be able to promise to yourself you will do, says a proverb out of dath ilan, if you're going to dare to try things like that in the first place

> she seems like a pretty standard '????????'* which, I guess, doesn't really have much of a Taldane translation now that I go looking for it."

> "Um, person who finds it hugely painful to be the slightest bit tactful to anyone or hold back her thoughts, and is constantly noticing how everything in Civilization is falling way short of her standards for how it ought to look namely perfect. You don't meet any of her standards either, but she thinks that way about everyone, so it isn't anything personal, or really about the person you yourself are at all."

> (*) Dath ilan doesn't quite have the concept that some other places might call by names like 'autistic', because it's a pretty different phenomenon when the weirdos in question have INT 22 and WIS 16, and also are embedded in a larger Civilization that doesn't think about weirdness the same way as some other places; namely weirdness = difference = specialization direction = exploit for comparative advantage.

"Tears and hugs don't solve anything," goes a proverb out of dath ilan, "so don't offer them to people who need solutions."
