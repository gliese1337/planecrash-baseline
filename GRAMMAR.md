Ethnography
-----------

Dath ilan is an alternate-history Earth envisioned by Eliezer Yudkowsky, whose history diverges at least a couple thousand years ago from our own, and in which civilization has achieved a much higher degree of global economic coordination. Part of this increased coordination is that everyone on dath ilan speaks, at minimum, an in-universe conlang called "Baseline". Out-of-universe, Baseline did not actually exist prior to Eliezer writing stories featuring Baseline-speaking dath ilanis--but descriptions of what it is like do exist in those stories, which can be used, to the extent that they are consistent, to infer a language consistent with the stories. 

Phonology
---------

The majority of canonical evidence for Baseline phonology comes from names:

    Alis       Athpechya  Bahb
    Bahdhi     Bohob      Corun
    Derrin     Elshorm    Elzbeth
    Helorm     Illeia     Karal
    Keltham    Limyar     Merrin
    Miyalsvor  Nemamel    Petheriel
    Ranthal    Salthin    Thellim
    Verrez

Most names have two syllables; a few (5 in this list) have 3, or maybe 4. "Bahb" is the only one-syllable names, but that is likely not representative of any real name used for a dath ilani person, as it appears in a context where it is clearly meant to be transcription of the English name "Bob", as part of the set "Alis, Bahb, and Karal", standing in for "Alice, Bob, and Carol", the standard placeholder names for participants in a cryptographic protocol. "Bohob" seems to be an alternative adaptation of "Bob" that fits Baseline naming patterns better. In combination with "Bahdhi", though, the orthographic possibility of "Bahb" suggests the existence of ⟨a⟩ and ⟨ah⟩ as separate vowels. If ⟨h⟩ can only occur in onset positions, there would be minimal ambiguity introduced in the Anglicization by adopting that convention.

⟨Illeia⟩ could be a four-syllable name, and ⟨Petheriel⟩ almost certainly is if it is meant to be pronounced in the "obvious" way, but we have a negative example in that ⟨Athpechya⟩ is presented as a dath ilani equivalent for a non-Baseline 4-syllable name, which has been cut down to 3 syllables (assuming ⟨y⟩ is to be interpreted as a consonant).

Our primary informant, Keltham, [at one point says](https://glowfic.com/replies/1625693#reply-1625693)

> Two syllables is long enough that you'd be moderately unlikely to be good friends with two people with the same name, so it's what most normies like my parents use in the modern generation.  I've considered changing mine to something four-syllabled just to be Chaotic about it, but common wisdom says I should let my personality finish shaking out up to age 25 first.

Which suggests that 4-syllable names are *possible*, but rare--probably over-represented by having the single unambiguous example of ⟨Petheriel⟩ in this small sample. If we don't want to end up with *two* such names in every 22, ⟨Illeia⟩ can be resolved to a 3-syllables name if we interpret that intervocalic ⟨i⟩ as a transcriptional variant of ⟨y⟩, much like ⟨c⟩ is a transcriptional variant of ⟨k⟩, rather than as a whole extra syllable.

As a cultural note, all dath ilani are mononymic, so there is nothing to be said about the structure of family names / patronymics.

The following non-personal-name words are also attested:

dath  
ilan  
raht  
tsi-imbi  
farsheth  
kelthorkarnen

In terms of explicit descriptions of Baseline's phonology, this is all we have:

> For example, all the phonemes are a minimum distance away from each other that guarantees people with slightly less acute hearing can understand it when spoken under slightly adverse conditions. In-between phonemes that are possible to pronounce, but potentially difficult to hear correctly, are then reserved for constructing 'conlangs', constructed languages, many of which use 'Baseline' as a baseline but add new short words using the expanded phoneme set.

Assuming that the attested words are meant to pronounced in ways intuitive to an Anglophone audience, and that these pronunciations are recognizably accurate to the native Baseline pronunciations, that claim seems not to be super well supported by the data. For example, it appears to contain all three of s/θ/f, which are easily confusable in low-fidelity audio environments. (TODO: Include literature review on phonetic confusion.) 

However, fortunately for us, the character who speaks that paragraph is not specifically trained in linguistics, and may not know exactly what he's talking about--and there are other constraints on the design of Baseline which may conflict with that one, such that the optimal design for Baseline phonology is not one which optimizes distinctness-of-phonemes in isolation. In particular, Baseline speakers seem to have a strong sense of syllables as the most salient components of word structure, and count of syllables as the obvious way to measure utterance length; and, they value having short words and short utterances for concepts that are common in their culture. Thus, we can also expect to have a large phonemic inventory to allow for the maximum number of individual syllables, maximum information per syllable, and maximal number of short words, which is in direct conflict with keeping individual phones as far apart from each other in acoustic space as possible.

From this data, we can infer that Baseline has a 6 vowel system:

|     | Front   | Back     |
|-----|---------|----------|
| Hi  | /i/ ⟨i⟩ | /u/ ⟨u⟩  |
| Mid | /ɛ/ ⟨e⟩ | /o/ ⟨o⟩  |
| Hi  | /æ/ ⟨a⟩ | /ɑ/ ⟨ah⟩ |

with three degrees of height, a binary front-back distinction, and rounding in the back non-low vowels.

It would be more in-line with designing for maximal distinctiveness if the ⟨e⟩ vowel were a little higher, to maximize contrast with /æ/, but we have an explicit negative example where [the dath ilani Merrin struggles to pronounce the French names "Félix" and "Élie"](https://www.glowfic.com/replies/1786094#reply-1786094), which confirms that the Baseline ⟨e⟩ vowel is *not* /e/.

Attested consonants, based on the assumption that names are supposed to be pronounced in the most obvious possible way for an Anglophone reader, are as follows:

p - /p/  
b - /b/  
t - /t/  
d - /d/  
k/c - /k/

f - /f/  
v - /v/  
s - /s/  
z - /z/  
th - /θ/  
dh - /ð/  
sh - /ʃ/  
h - /h/

ts - /t͡s/  
ch - /t͡ʃ/

l - /L/ (for maximal distinctiveness from /j/, we assume this to be a dark/velarized l, rather than copying English's light/dark allophony; the presence of this and /v/ justify the lack of /w/)  
r - /r/ (for maximal distinctiveness from /l/, we assume this to be a tap/trill even though that's not the *most* natural reading for most Anglophones).  
y - /j/

m - /m/  
n - /n/

We interpret ⟨ts⟩ as an affricate on the basis that there are no other word-initial apparent clusters, and that the affricate ⟨ch⟩ is unambiguously attested (so the category of affricates clearly exists in Baseline's inventory).

The lack of /g/ is not typologically odd on its own, but given the fairly robust fairly robust voicing distinction for most plosives and fricatives, we can infer that there should also be \*/g/, \*/ʒ/, \*/d͡z/, and \*/d͡ʒ, phonemes, even though they happen to be missing from this dataset, on the basis that, having decided that voicing was usefully distinctive for all other obstruents, the in-world engineers of Baseline wouldn't have just left those specific place/manner combinations unused!

Now, let us consider the case of ⟨tsi-imbi⟩ a little more closely. It's the only attested word with a hyphen in it, and the only word with consecutive identical vowels if you ignore the hyphen. In fact, no attested words have consecutive vowels at all! I infer that this is to maximize the ease of syllable segmentation, and that the hyphen should in fact represent an additional marginal glottal stop (/ʔ/) phoneme (such as shows up in the English "uh-oh"), which shows up wherever vowels would otherwise be in hiatus. That also allows to resolve any possible ambiguity in the usage of ⟨ah⟩ to transcribe the low-back vowel. Something like ⟨bahob⟩ (a minimal change from the attested ⟨Bohob⟩) would have to be read as /bæ.hob/, while /baob/ would be phonetically [ba.ʔ.ob], with extra-metrical /ʔ/, and transcribed as ⟨bah-ob⟩--and /ba.hob/ would be ⟨bahhob⟩. The hyphen can also be used in Anglicization to break disambiguate Ch digraphs from C.h sequences across syllable boundaries; e.g., /a.θa/ would be written ⟨atha⟩, /aθ.ha/ would be written ⟨athha⟩, and /at.ha/ would be written ⟨at-ha⟩.

This lack of vowel length or hiatrus vowels raises another potential problem with the transcription of other consonants; while we have examples of single intervocalic ⟨l⟩ and ⟨r⟩, there are also a few instance of doubled ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨rr⟩--but no other doubled consonants. And if we aren't allowing doubled vowels, having geminate continuant consonants across syllable boundaries seems like a very weird choice, completely counter to the goal of making syllabic segmentation easy and unambiguous. One could imagine heterosyllabic /l.ʔ.l/ and /r.ʔ.r/ sequences, with epenthetic glottal stops separating syllables just like they do between vowels, but in the absence of written hyphens in the attested names, I am going to assume that the doubled letters are there purely for purposes of Anglophone aesthetics, and that cross-syllable geminates do not actually exist in Baseline.

That leads to the following consonants chart:

|             | Labial      | Dental        | Alveolar        | Palatal        | Velar       | Glottal |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Plosive     | p ⟨p⟩ b ⟨b⟩ |               | t ⟨t⟩ d ⟨d⟩     |                | k ⟨k⟩ g ⟨g⟩ | (ʔ) ⟨-⟩ |
| Nasal       | m ⟨m⟩       |               | n ⟨n⟩           |                |             |         |
| Trill       |             |               | r ⟨r⟩           |                |             |         |
| Fricative   | f ⟨f⟩ v ⟨v⟩ | θ ⟨th⟩ ð ⟨dh⟩ | s ⟨s⟩ z ⟨z⟩     | ʃ ⟨sh⟩ ʒ ⟨zh⟩  |             | h ⟨h⟩   |
| Affricate   |             |               | t͡s ⟨ts⟩ d͡z ⟨dz⟩ | t͡ʃ ⟨ch⟩ d͡ʒ ⟨j⟩ |             |         |
| Approximant |             |               |                 | j ⟨y⟩          | L ⟨l⟩       |         |

The Anglicization is slightly complicated by transcribing /k/ as ⟨c⟩ instead of ⟨k⟩ when it precedes ⟨o⟩, and /j/ and ⟨i⟩ instead of ⟨y⟩ when it is between two vowels.

The fricatives are a little bit weird; why include θ/ð alone in their column, rather than bringing in the velar fricatives x/ɣ to maximize distinctiveness and get slightly better correspondence between fricative and plosive series? But perhaps the in-world justification is that they just Wanted More Options for making more short words, and the possibility of x/h confusion pushed for pulling in the dental fricatives instead, despite the labial/dental/alveolar confusability, to allow for including h.

For the plosives, maximizing distinctiveness suggests that all of the voiceless plosives should also be secondarily aspirated--we've only got two plosive series, so we might as well make them as phonetically distinctive as possible!

We can also infer the following apparent phonotactic rules:

Syllables have the form (C1)V((r)C2)(s|z)), where:
* C1 is any consonant.
* C2 is any consonant except /h/
* The optional /r/ cannot occur before another /r/ in the C2 slot.
* The optional final sibilant cannot occur after another sibilant in the C2 slot.
* /s/ cannot occur after voiced stops/fricatives
* /z/ cannot occur-- after voiceless stops/fricatives

Within a word:
* A syllable cannot end with the same consonant with which the next syllable starts (nor should t/d precede t͡s/d͡z or t͡ʃ/d͡ʒ, respectively).
* Vowels cannot occur in hiatus, and l and r cannot in hiatus with themselves, with extra-syllabic glottal stops being inserted for repair.

Making codas more complex than onsets is just weird, and there does not seem to be any clear in-world justification, but that seems to be where the available data is pointing. Maybe it is meant to allows sub-syllable-level suffixing/infixing morphology?

Based on character's commenting on how many syllables are required to say something in various languages, and treating syllable count as a reliable measure of how long an utterance is / how much effort it takes to express something, we can infer that the language is syllable-timed, rather than stress- or mora-timed.

Making another default assumption that the maximum onset principle for syllabification applies, the attested syllables are as follows:

a ath  
i im  
el elz  
bah bahb  
beth bi bo  
dath dhi  
far  
he hob  
ka kar kel ko  
lan le lim lis lorm  
ma me mel mi  
ne nen  
pech  
raht ral ran rez ri rin run  
sal  
sheth shorm  
thal tham the thin thor  
tsi 
ver vor 
ya yals yar 

The possible syllables are a much larger set, totalling 12,000. However, depending on morphological rules, not all of these will necessarily be available for assignment to unique lexical items.

Personal & Demonstrative Pronouns
--------

All personal pronouns are invariant for all grammatical functions.

The first person singular pronoun is ⟨mi⟩.

The second person singular pronoun is ⟨ti⟩. The plural is ⟨vi⟩.

For third person, Baseline uses a single series of personal and demonstrative pronouns. These use a common rime of ⟨-em⟩ for singular and ⟨-erm⟩ for plural, with onset consonants varying to agree alliteratively with the onset of the antecedent. There are twelve total agreement forms, as follows:

|  Form  | Agr. Classes |
|--------|--------------|
| ⟨pem⟩  |    p-, b-    |
| ⟨tem⟩  |  t-, d-, r-  | 
| ⟨kem⟩  |    k-, g-    |
| ⟨hem⟩  |    V-, h-    |
| ⟨nem⟩  |    m-, n-    | 
| ⟨vem⟩  |    f-, v-    |
| ⟨dhem⟩ |    θ-, ð-    |
| ⟨zem⟩  |    s-, z-    |
| ⟨zhem⟩ |    ʃ-, ʒ-    |
| ⟨tsem⟩ |   t͡s-, d͡z-   |
| ⟨chem⟩ |   t͡ʃ-, d͡ʒ-   |
| ⟨yem⟩  |    j-, l-    |

These forms are always endophoric; that is, that refer to some other phrase in the ongoing discourse. When used in the determiner slot of an argument phrase, the noun complement serves to further restrict what the whole determiner phrase may be referring to, giving greater specificity than the pronoun on its own. Alternately, this can be interpreted as the determiner restricting the noun to co-refer to something else in the discourse.

The prefix ⟨e-⟩ derives *exophoric* demonstratives--pronouns which rever to something in the world external to the discourse, and bring that entity into the discourse. If used with a noun, the demonstrative will always agree with the head of the noun phrase; when used in isolation, however, an exophoric demonstrative may not have any formal linguistic expression to agree with (since the thing it refers to is by definition not yet part of the discourse); for example, when asking "What is that?" In such cases, ⟨eyem⟩ serves as the default, generic demonstrative.

Baseline does not distinguish distal vs. proximal demonstratives.

First person plurals are formed by compounding the first person singular with second and third person pronouns, forming the following set of 8 pronouns:

* ⟨miti⟩ - me and you, the two of us.
* ⟨mivi⟩ - me and all of you
* ⟨miyem⟩ - me and him/her/it, but not you
* ⟨miyerm⟩ - me and them, but not you.
* ⟨mitem⟩ - the two of us and he/she/it
* ⟨miterm⟩ - the two of us and them.
* ⟨mivem⟩ - me, all of you, and he/she/it
* ⟨miverm⟩ - me, all of you, and them.

Numerals
--------

Baseline digits (atomic cardinal numerals) are all single closed syllables beginning with one of seven voiceless consonants: 
⟨p⟩ ⟨sh⟩ ⟨t⟩ ⟨f⟩ ⟨k⟩ ⟨ch⟩ ⟨s⟩.

No two digits form a minimal pair; that is, all digits differ by at least two phonemes, which is accomplished by varying codas. Additionally, numerically-adjacent digits have onsets which differ in both place and manner of articulation

There are 21 digits constructed from 3 cycles of the seven onset consonants, paired with 7 cycles of the 3 cardinal vowels: ⟨i⟩ ⟨ah⟩ ⟨u⟩. Each cycle of onsets has a distinct coda, from a set of voiced consonants chosen for ease of clear articulation in hiatus with any numeral onset, and avoiding ⟨r⟩ for morphological reasons: ⟨n⟩ ⟨dh⟩ ⟨l⟩

| Value | Numeral | Value | Numeral | Value | Numeral |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| 0     | ⟨pin⟩   | 7     | ⟨pahdh⟩ | 14    | ⟨pul⟩   |
| 1     | ⟨shahn⟩ | 8     | ⟨shudh⟩ | 15    | ⟨shil⟩  |
| 2     | ⟨tun⟩   | 9     | ⟨tidh⟩  | 16    | ⟨tahl⟩  |
| 3     | ⟨fin⟩   | 10    | ⟨fahdh⟩ | 17    | ⟨ful⟩   |
| 4     | ⟨kahn⟩  | 11    | ⟨kudh⟩  | 18    | ⟨kil⟩   |
| 5     | ⟨chun⟩  | 12    | ⟨chidh⟩ | 19    | ⟨chahl⟩ |
| 6     | ⟨sin⟩   | 13    | ⟨sahdh⟩ | 20    | ⟨sul⟩   |

Sequences of consecutive digits form compound numerals which are interpreted as big-endian place-value representations of a number. By default, digit strings are interpreted in base 12, and no digit larger than 11 ⟨kudh⟩ may occur in such a number. Note that any isolated digit may be used to represent its inherent value in any context; thus, while it is possible to represent, e.g., 15 as a base-12 digit string ⟨shahnfin⟩, it would be more typical to simply say ⟨shil⟩. When a single digit occurs more than twice in a row in a digit string, the onset consonant of alternating digits, starting with the second occurrence, is voiced, to assist with keeping track of digit positions. Thus, 26388 ("13330" in base 12) would be represented as ⟨shahnfinvinfinpin⟩, not \*⟨shahnfinfinfinpin⟩. This is a much more frequent occurrence when expressing numbers in smaller bases. This voicing alternation is not a waste of phonetic material as the alternate forms never appear as independent words, and so do not produce a homophone conflict with any actual independent words. Avoiding a lexical segmentation conflict just requires that those syllables not be assigned as independent words to anything which is grammatically countable.

Non-integer quantities are expressed by using the infix operator ⟨pok⟩, representing a radix point, to separate the whole-number part from the fractional part of a complex numeral. Thus, 2.5 is ⟨tunpoksin⟩. Leading zeroes can be omitted; thus, 0.25 is ⟨pokfin⟩, or ⟨pinpokfin⟩.

Ordinal digits are formed with an infix ⟨-r-⟩. Thus, "first" is ⟨shahrn⟩, "twelveth" is ⟨chirdh⟩, "twentieth" is ⟨surl⟩, etc. Compound ordinal numerals use ordinal digits throughout. Thus, "one-hundred-fourty-fourth" is ⟨chirdhchirdh⟩, not \*⟨chidhchirdh⟩ or \*⟨chirdhchidh⟩. This ensures that there is no ambiguity about boundaries when different numeral classes may appear in hiatus. This occurs, for example, in the expression of rational numbers, which are formed by using a cardinal numerator to quantify over an ordinal denominator, much like English. Thus, "seven eighths" is ⟨pahv shurdh⟩, and "thirty-seven one-hundred-fourty-fourths" is ⟨fintun chirdhchirdh⟩.

While 12 is the default base, in certain contexts digit strings may be interpreted in any other base less than 21. The simplest example of this is the use of the ⟨pirnz⟩ construction. A digit with the ⟨pirn-⟩ prefix and ⟨-z⟩ suffix may be preposed to any syntactic scope to alter the interpretation of digit strings within that scope. For example, placing ⟨pirnsulz⟩ immediately before a digit string will cause that digit string (and any embedded digit strings within a noun phrase over which that digit string quantifies) to be interpreted in base-20. Thus, ⟨kudhpin⟩ is 132, but ⟨pirnsulz kudhpin⟩ is 240. Another common construction uses the prefix ⟨tu-⟩ with ordinal derivation (using infix ⟨-r-⟩) to produce specialized base indicator which further specify that a single numeral should be interpreted in the given base, but then divided by the square of that base. Thus, ⟨tufahrdh⟩ translates the English "percent", while ⟨tuchirdh⟩ means "interpret in base 12, then divide by 144"--a base-12 equivalent of "percent". "Thirty-seven one-hundred-fourty-fourths" may thus be alternately expressed as ⟨tuchirdh fintun⟩, while "52 percent" may be expressed as ⟨tufahrdh chuntun⟩.

Digits and digit strings can also be used in a larger construction which avoids the need to state an explicit base. An ordinal digit string compounded to a cardinal digit string with the suffix ⟨-z⟩ expresses exponentiation ("read as CAR to the ORD power times..."), and may be followed by a unit multiplier (an integer, rational, or radix-point numeral) interpreted in the base of the exponentiated cardinal digit. Note that the ⟨pirnz⟩ construction described above is an extension of this pattern--it can be literally read as "X to the 0th power times...", which is otherwise functionally vacuous, as it would literally entail nothing more than multiplying by 1.

Multiple exponent constructions in sequence have their values summed. This allows easy expression of large quantities whose digit-string representations may have lots of zeroes; e.g, "one million two hundred" may be expressed as ⟨sirnfahdhz shahn turnfahdhz tun⟩ (6 syllables), rather than ⟨pirnfahdhz shahnpinbinpintunpinpin⟩ (base 10, 9 syllables) or ⟨kahnpintuntidhfahdhpin⟩ (base 12, 6 syllables).

Note that there is no requirement that the bases of different terms in an exponential expression must be the same! However, switching radices with multiplier terms larger than 20 (thus, requiring digit string representation) is usually unnecessarily cognitively-taxing.
