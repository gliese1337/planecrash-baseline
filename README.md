This is documentation for the Baseline language of dath ilan, the alternate-history Earth created Eliezer Yudkowski, as inferred from the evidence in the [Planecrash stories on glowfic.com](https://www.glowfic.com/boards/215).

* GRAMMAR.md is the main grammatical description, in the form of a reference grammar.
* WORDFORMS.md is a list of valid but unused wordforms that can be assigned meanings to fill in the Baseline lexicon. There 12,000 possible monosyllables, but, depending on how the morphology works out, it is possible that not all of those may be available for assignment to unique lexical items.
* TRANSLATIONS.md is a collection of English texts claimed to be translated from Baseline, which should be translated into inferred Baseline to exercise the language and provide material for examples to include in the reference grammar. Each text should be annotated with a link to the glowfic tag from it was extracted in the Planecrash canon. Several canonical translations are stated to require a specific number of syllables in Baseline, which will constrain the design of the lexicon and morphology.

* Finish compiling translations
* Annotate translations with source links.
* Create a SIL Toolbox MDF dictionary once enough of the lexicon and grammar are worked out to structure it properly.
